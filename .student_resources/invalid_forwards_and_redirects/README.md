# Invalid Forwards and Redirects

Invalid (or unvalidated) forwards and redirects are a form of user-controlled input in which a web application accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect. Because the domain name in the modified link is identical to the trusted domain name, phishing attempts may appear more trustworthy.

This vulnerability is often combined with a CSRF, man in the middle or website spoofing as a more complex threat vector.

```HTTP
https://www.trustedwebsite.com/examples/example.php?url=http://www.malicious.com
```

| Protocol | subdomain | domain             | path     | endpoint     | parameters                   |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| https    | www       | trustedwebsite.com | examples | example.html | url=http://www.malicious.com |

## How to penetrate test for this vulnerability

1. Look for forms collecting URLs that are rendered on the front end. Enter a malicious URL and see if it validates and renders.
2. Look for frontend URL, path, or endpoint parameter passing, construct a URL to an untrusted domain, and test whether the site redirects. `https://127.0.0.1:5000?url=http://www.malicious.com`

## How to countermeasure this vulnerability

1. Code review
2. Explicitly declare the protocol, subdomain and domain as a minimum in the backend code and do not allow URLS to be manipulated by input.
3. Validate inputs, if a form requires URL's use regular expressions to explicitly define the URL specifications (HTTPS, subdomains, domains, paths and endpoints were possible) and exclusions ( >, <, ?, etc). This is particularly important if the input will be rendered on the front end or processed in the backend.
4. Update backend languages (early versions of asp.net are vulnerable)
